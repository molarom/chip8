# CHIP-8 Emulator

A fun side project I've been working on for some time now.
Started as a joke when a collegue of mine told me I should write Pong in C, so I cut out the middle man and decided to build an emulator.

## TODO

[ ] - Finish SDL implementation.
[ ] - Add sound output.
[ ] - Clean up the garbage.
[ ] - Add debugging window.
[ ] - Maybe add Super CHIP-8?
